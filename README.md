# Emulator stylesheet for Facebook Instant Articles

Preview your Facebook Instant Articles on your website as soon as you've created an article, rather than relying on Facebook's iOS Page Manager app.

1. Create a new template for your blog posts, and dynamically feed in your blog content using Facebook's guideline for structuring your content:
[Facebook Instant Articles Document Structure](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/guides/articlecreate)

2. Use the emulator SCSS to display your content as it will appear in Facebook Instant Articles.

Tip: if you would like to view your articles natively, set up FB Instant Articles using [this guide from Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/quickstart) then download the [Facebook Pages Manager app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/facebook-pages-manager/id514643583)
